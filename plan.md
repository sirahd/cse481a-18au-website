![Project architecture](/assets/architecture.png)

Our software stack consists of REST API, using [Django REST Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/), web frontend using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and SQL Server Database.
Most of our backend API services are implemented in Python, which then auto-generates SQL query to our SQL server.
